--Used to create a view to filter weather data to all zip codes in Trenton Falls, NY
--This helps us address several limitations:
--Not all stations in NY track temperature
----so focusing on a location that does gives us more accurate data
--The API the weather data is retrieved from has a limit of 1000 station hours per pull, 
----focusing on a single station allows us to pull several years of data

# BigData_Capstone824

## This a team capstone submission for Purude University MGMT 59000 AI Assisted Big Data in the Cloud
# the intention is to combine at least one (in this case 2) Archived (herein referred to as static) data sets with one live API to analyze energy consumption patterns.
#
# We are attempting to analyze historical weather data and energy consumption data in order to correlate consumption with temperature in a given location (Trenton Falls, NY). 
# Using our analysis, we attempt to use live weather data to estimate the likely monthly average temperature, and through it, the likely energy consumption.
#
# We believe that this will allow energy producers to more accurately project usage by location in the future. While temperature is not the only factor in determining usage,
# many other prediction models, such as predictions based on cell phone usage, are not able to be adjusted by seasonal factors. We believe our model could be used to augment
# other models in the future, addresssing the limitations of both models.
